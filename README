Intro
------
I wrote this as a POC back in 2009 after an illuminating with Roy Hills (NTA Monitor). The discussion went something like this: "it would be great to code up a faster SSL cipher enumeration tool that only performed the initial SSL HELLO request, and that didn't rely on OpenSSL." The key advantages here are speed and the ability to discover proprietary ciphers not supported by OpenSSL".

Although I've made a couple of recent changes, this code is the result of a few late nights back in 2009 and should be considered ALPHA :)

Installation
------------
$ make

Usage
-----
$ usage: ./ssl-enum -s hostname/ip (opt: -p 8443 -f otherciphers,-v[1-5],-k)
	-s hostname or IP address of target.
	-v1 
		Increase level of verbosity (v1 - v5).
	-f filename
		Allows alternate ciphers file. The default is cipher-list.txt.
   	-k ends scan early if non-standard responses.
        	Some SSL/TLS services don't respond with SSL errors so we assume its
        	an UNSUPPORTED cipher. To complicate matters further, some Apache &
		IIS configurations will allow weak SSL connections but don't allow
		access at the application layer. This lets the web server produce a
		"pretty" error message but breaks SSL scanning. More work needed here.
