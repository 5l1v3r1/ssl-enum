SSL-Enum is a standalone SSL/TLS scanner.

There are a number of SSL cipher enumeration tools but (that I've seen) rely on OpenSSL or SSLeay and are not very flexible.

SSL-Enum hopes to become a flexible, standalone SSL inspection tool.

Please be aware the tools is still very much BETA and contributing is welcome and encouraged.
